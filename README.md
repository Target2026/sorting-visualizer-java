# Java Sorting Visualizer

👋 **Hi!** This is a simple **Sorting Visualizer** built in **Java** using the **Swing framework**.

It demonstrates how **Bubble Sort** and **Selection Sort** algorithms work in real-time with animated bars.  
This project is perfect for practicing **DSA concepts**, **multithreading**, and **Java GUI programming**.
